RESULTS OF PROGRAM 2
____________________________
i ran this on cunix
i compiled it with javac Program2.java
ran it with java Program2 -Xint
i omitted the first enqueue and dequeue timings because they were significantly greater but the rest reflected 
as explained below

Enqueue: 1445
Enqueue: 1170
Enqueue: 1150
Enqueue: 1105
Enqueue: 979
Dequeue: 646
Dequeue: 1027
Dequeue: 751
Dequeue: 702

null
Dequeue: 21416 //reflects O(N)

_____________________________
Explanation: 
The enqueue function reflects O(1)
The dequeue function reflects O(1) WHEN there are items in the queue
HOWEVER, the dequeue function reflects O(N) when there are NULL items in the queue
Therefore the dequeue function is still O(N)
THEREFORE THE OVERALL TIME COMPLEXITY OF THE QUEUE IS STILL O(N)
