Rectangle Class implements Comparable:
Really, simple, 2 instance variables: length and width
followed by 5 methods{getWidth, getPerimeter, getLength, toString, (overriden)compareTo}
method explanations
getWidth: returns width of the rectangle
getLength: returns length of the rectangle
getPerimeter: returns perimeter(the perimeter formula)
toString sets a preset string reply
**Most Important** compareTo method: compares rectangles by perimeter basis of Problem1 and Problem2 classes

Problem1 Class: **Find Max Rectangle**
I created an array of type rectangles and allowed a total of SIX yes SIX rectangles not FIVE, SIX, I AM BADASS!
Anyway I then used a for loop to fill the rectangle array with random widths and random lengths.
I double confirm whether this is working by printing out the array of rectangles. (thank god it works)
I then print out the largest rectangle of the array. Since I can't change the findMax method given in the HW,
if there are two of the same max perimeter's it will just return the max perimeter even though it has 2 max perimeters, 
which works fine.

Problem2 Class: **Binary Search Recursively**
Created a rectangle array with 7 rectangles, filled them up randomly again.
